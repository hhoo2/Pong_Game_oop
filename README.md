# Pong Game
Author - Hay Oo

This is a simple object-oriented implementation of the classic Pong game in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game sets up a game screen, paddles, a ball, a scoreboard, and a centerline. Players can control their paddles using the keyboard, and the objective is to bounce the ball past the opponent's paddle to score points. The game continues until one player wins by reaching the specified score limit, or you can close the game window by clicking.

## How to Play

1. **Game Window Setup**: The game window is created with a black background and dimensions of 800x600 pixels.

2. **Paddles, Ball, and Scoreboard**: Two paddles (left and right), a ball, and a scoreboard are initialized. The left paddle is controlled using the 'W' and 'S' keys, while the right paddle is controlled using the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys.

3. **Game Instructions**: Upon starting the game, you will see a set of instructions in a pop-up dialog box. This dialog provides information on how to play and the objective of the game. You can click "OK" to start the game.

4. **Game Loop**: The game runs in a loop until a player reaches the winning score or you close the game window. The game loop controls the ball's movement, detects collisions with the walls and paddles, and updates the score based on the ball's position.

5. **Scoring**: The game uses a simple scoring system where the first player to reach a predefined number of points wins. The default winning score is set to 3 points for each player.

6. **Game Over**: When a player reaches the winning score, the game ends, and you can close the window by clicking anywhere on the screen.

## Controls

- **Right Paddle (Player 1)**: Use the 'Up' arrow key to move the paddle up and the 'Down' arrow key to move the paddle down.

- **Left Paddle (Player 2)**: Use the 'W' key to move the paddle up and the 'S' key to move the paddle down.
